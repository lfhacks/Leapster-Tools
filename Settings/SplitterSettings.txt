? If this is your first time opening this, before you edit this file, please read the following information:
? Full line comments in this format are stored with a question mark at the start. 
? End of line comments are stored after underscores ("_"). In the current implementation, these are required on any line with a settings variable! Don't remove them.
? This format is set up to be as easy for me to implement as possible. 
? Please avoid messing with it outside of changing the numbers to ensure that LeapSplit doesn't crash.
? For the get(asset type) variables, 1 is on and 0 is off. Disabling stuff can save quite a bit of time if you only want one specific asset type.
